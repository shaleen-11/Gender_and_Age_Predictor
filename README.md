# Dataset Information

UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc.

The objective of the project is to detect gender and age using facial images. Convolutional Neural Network is used to classify the images. There are 2 output types namely, gender(M or F) and age.

# Project Information

Designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to predict age and gender from facial images. The model was trained on a dataset of grayscale images, and achieves remarkable accuracy with 90% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6. A standout feature of this project is the capability to process and predict demographic attributes from a single image in real-time. The robust preprocessing pipeline includes resizing, normalization, and reshaping, enabling seamless integration of new image data for immediate predictions. This feature makes it exceptionally valuable for applications requiring instant demographic insights from individual images, providing an intuitive and powerful tool for various real-world scenarios. The project showcases a complete workflow from data handling to model deployment, with advanced techniques ensuring high performance and reliability.
